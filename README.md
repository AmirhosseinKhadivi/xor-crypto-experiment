# xor-crypto-experiment

A small Python experiment implementing a **repeating-key XOR cipher** with a simple Tkinter GUI.
This project was written offline for learning purposes.

> ⚠️ **Not secure**  
> Repeating-key XOR ciphers are vulnerable to multiple known attacks and must not be used in production.

## What this shows
- Basic reversible encryption using XOR
- Effects of key reuse on security
- Simple GUI wiring with Tkinter
